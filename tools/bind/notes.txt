questions:
may be apis.lib for api without dll/vio and apif.lib with dll/vio?



BIND performs three major steps:
 
1. For imported functions, BIND reads the dynamic-link entry
   points from the OS/2 executable file. For each function, BIND
   writes an EXTDEF object record to a temporary object file.
   Each EXTDEF record is associated with an external reference
   that the linker must resolve.

2. BIND uses WLINK to link the executable file, the temporary
   object file, the API.LIB file, and any other libraries
   specified on the BIND command line.

   The API.LIB library file supplies a stub loader module. This
   module loads the OS/2 executable file in a DOS environment
   and simulates the OS/2 startup conditions. API.LIB also
   supplies code that emulates the OS/2 Family API (Family
   Application Program Interface) in a DOS environment.

3. BIND merges the OS/2 protected-mode and DOS real-mode executable files
   into a single file that runs in either mode.

BIND searches for API.LIB and OS2.LIB in the directories specified
by the LIB environment variable. If you have not set the LIB
variable, or if API.LIB or OS2.LIB reside elsewhere, enter a full
path name in the <linklibs> field.
