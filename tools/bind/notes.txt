questions:
may be apis.lib for api without dll/vio and apif.lib with dll/vio?


How bind must works:

BIND performs three major steps:
 
1. For imported functions, BIND reads the dynamic-link entry
   points from the OS/2 executable file. For each function, BIND
   writes an EXTDEF object record to a temporary object file.
   Each EXTDEF record is associated with an external reference
   that the linker must resolve.

2. BIND uses WLINK to link the executable file, the temporary
   object file, the API.LIB file, and any other libraries
   specified on the BIND command line.

   The API.LIB library file supplies a stub loader module. This
   module loads the OS/2 executable file in a DOS environment
   and simulates the OS/2 startup conditions. API.LIB also
   supplies code that emulates the OS/2 Family API (Family
   Application Program Interface) in a DOS environment.

3. BIND merges the OS/2 protected-mode and DOS real-mode executable files
   into a single file that runs in either mode.

BIND searches for API.LIB and OS2.LIB in the directories specified
by the LIB environment variable. If you have not set the LIB
variable, or if API.LIB or OS2.LIB reside elsewhere, enter a full
path name in the <linklibs> field.
	 
 BIND infile [implibs] [linklibs] [options]
 
     The <infile> field is required; all others are optional. Options
     must be entered last.
 
     <infile>     The name of the OS/2 program to be bound. BIND
                  looks in the current directory unless you specify
                  a complete path name. If you provide no extension,
                  .EXE is assumed.
 
     <implibs>    The names of one or more import libraries. Use this
                  field if your program calls functions imported using
                  import libraries.
                  
                  You can specify the file APILMR.OBJ, which provides a
                  64K default data segment when running in real mode.
                  
 
     <linklibs>   The names of one or more libraries and object
                  files. Use this field to supply object code needed
                  to resolve dynamic-link calls. Separate file names
                  with spaces.
 
                  BIND automatically searches for API.LIB and OS2.LIB.
                  If you want additional libraries, be sure to specify
                  the full path name.
                  
 
     <options>    
	 
     BIND options must appear last on the command line. You can specify
     options in uppercase or lowercase and use a single letter or the
     full option name. For example, /M, /m, /MAP, and /map are
     equivalent.
 
     Option         Action
 
     /HELP          Displays Help
     /M[AP]         Generates Link Map File
     /N[AMES]       Specifies Protected-Mode Functions
     /NOLOGO        Suppresses Sign-On Banner
     /O[UTFILE]     Specifies Name of Bound Program
     /?             Displays Short Help
